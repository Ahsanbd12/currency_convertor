# Poject Name
Currency Convertor

# Problem Statement
Create a page with real currency conversion from USD to JPY and USD to COP and store it in the db. You need to retrieve the converted amount and display it in the nice format on the screen. The app should be able to convert from JPY, COP back to USD and store it and display. It should work vice versa.
Once your code is ready, please create a public repo in github/gitlab and share the URL to the repo to share your code. Along with that, please send us a test heroku link where we can see your result and test it as well.
